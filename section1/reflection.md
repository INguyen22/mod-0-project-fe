## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I tend to wait too long. this is because i'm nervous about others seeing me as "un-capable". As a result, i try to find the answer by myself even though i could've found a solution or a guide if i had asked for help. However, after reading the blog, i feel a bit more inclined to ask questions since i know my cohort is also learning something new beside me.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

- String: Any series of characters between quotation marks
- Number: Any positive, negative, and decimal number
- Boolean: If its a yes or no kind of variable its a boolean that assesses the variable with "true" or "false"

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

var statement = "Hello World!";
console.log(statement)

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

- i would use "/* */" to write comments that involve multiple lines and would use "//" when writing comments that only need one line
- The purpose of a comment is to elaborate more on a line of code of "what and why" the code was written vs "how" so that if anyone were to look at your code, they would understand what each line is or for you to catch back up if you dropped the project for a few days.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

- A variable is like a rule in a game. You can assign it a meaning but it can change depending on the situation you're using it in.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

- Youtube variables: the videos on the website, age of users, childfriendly contents.

this is a bit iffy and can be debated but the Strings can be the names of all the videos youtube has, the Number will be the age of the users on the site, and the Boolean would be youtube checking if a video is child-friendly, if not then it will turn off comments on the video.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

- Concatenation is a way to make a sentence with variables in a very un-efficient way and it will make JavaScript put it all together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

- Excel uses concatenation to format names or get someones address easier if it's been divided and categorized into bits and pieces.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

- It's a lot to handle/remember all at once so will we have more practice besides this mod 0 project?

- why would i use concatenation instead of interpolation? it wasn't explained very well in the lesson. i could google it but what is turings stance on it?

- comparisons are a bit much right now too. especially with "null" and "undefined" when set to...equal each other? is there a simple way to explain that kind of comparison?
