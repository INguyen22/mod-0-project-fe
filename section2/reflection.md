## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- The first thing that stood out to me was that one will be actively seeking out challenges in order to improve themselves. I have a cousin who went through Turing
and when i asked her what she was recently doing at work, she said she was quitting because she didn't feel like she was being challenged anymore
and that she believes she could learn more. I didn't understand her intention at first, because who the heck would leave a good paying/stable job to
seek out a challenge? I know have a better understanding as to why she did what she did and i want to be that person who keeps improving themselves.

- In the video, Carmen Popviciu gave us insight to her life. How you should track your own progress instead of comparing yourself to others as it could de-motivate you
from improving yourself. I'm the type that, unfortunately, compares myself to others constantly. Always asking "Why can't i do this blah blah can do it".
I realize thats an healthy mindset and i've been trying to get better at not being so hard on myself since my middleschool days.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- One way i believe i've demonstrated this "Growth Mindset" is by applying to Turing. At first, i was content with my degree in chemistry and becoming a pharmacy tech.
But as i worked and got my paychecks... i realized i wasn't happy and not making enough to support a future i would want to have.
Examples: Move out, get a house, eat luxurious food, buy all the anime figures i want.
My family urged me to look into Turing and i finally decided that if i wanted to make a better future for myself, i would need to better myself by learning a new skill that could pave my way.

- One way i don't demonstrate this mindset is when i start comparing myself to others. I see how smart my cohort is and I start to ask myself if i'm really capable.
The answer is YES since we're all learning but i'm still trying to get my mind to be more accepting of that belief.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

- To be honest, it was a bit off putting. it was like having a tricycle for 2 minutes and then being thrown on a motorcycle (exaggerated but still lol)
However, it really pushed me to try to comprehend the instructions more and do research of my own. When i was able to figure it out, it was just a big "AHA!" moment.
I do notice that the examples that are being provided in the exercises are being reduced and it made me worried on whether or not i was doing the assignment right.
But again, it pushed my to actually think instead of looking at the examples and trying to make my answer work/match.
This was especially prominent if the "if-statements" exercise when we were asked to make a condition for pizza. Looking back, i had a lot of fun just
trying to figure how to structure things and how to make it work.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

-A conditional statement is "if something happens then this should happen. if not, then this happens".
One example of this is: On amazon, if i buy a anime figure then I will get it shipped to my house.
If i don't get it, then nothing will happen and i save money.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

- You can add multiple conditions to an 'if' statement by doing 'else if' and then stating a new condition. You can keep doing that but it will probably look messy and your computer might take a bit to figure out what's going on because, if the first condition is not true then it moves on to the next one and sees if it's true or not. You computer will keep checking each condition until it finds a true statement and when it does, it stops and executes that line of code and whatever else you want it to do in that situation.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

- You can use logical operators: The AND operator (&&) is used when you need two or more conditions to be met.
The OR operator (||) is used when you need only one of the two or more conditions to be met.

- In addition to the logical operators, you can use the dev console in a browser (in the console tab) to run code and call variables to see what the output will be before
running a block of code.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

- 'if' statements are fine but they seem a bit...messy. if i had 20 conditions, that would take forever to code. is there a faster way?

- can we mix AND and OR in one condition? For example: you can make pizza if you have 2 cups of flour and sauce (or you can use water if there is no sauce)

- The story scenario in the decision-making exercise was fun. will we be encountering more or even making our own?
